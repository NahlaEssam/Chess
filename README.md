# Chess
Chess has become quite popular in recent years with numerous online platforms. 
The objective of this react web application is to simply string together  "chess.js" and "chessboardjsx" to create a web app that does the following:
  1. Display a chess board which the user can interact with.
  2. Implement valid chess-logic (only legal moves can be made on the board).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
